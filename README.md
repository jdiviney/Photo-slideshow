## ✨ What This Integration Does

Album Slideshow creates a **camera entity** that automatically cycles through images from:

- **Google Photos** shared albums  
- **Immich** (direct API): album, person, favorites, all, random, or a custom search  
- **PhotoPrism** (direct API): album, person, favorites, all, or a custom search  
- **iCloud** Shared Albums (public link)  
- **Synology Photos** (direct API): favorites, albums, people, places, tags or subjects  
- **Nextcloud**: an authenticated WebDAV folder (full metadata) or a public Nextcloud Photos album link (no login needed)  
- **Ente Photos** public albums (end-to-end encrypted, decrypted inside Home Assistant)  
- **Local folders** and NAS mounted directories  
- Home Assistant **Media Source** (local media, Jellyfin, ...)  

All behavior is exposed as Home Assistant entities. Adjust everything live without YAML edits or restarts.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📷 Slideshow Camera
- Auto advancing camera entity
- Configurable slide interval
- Manual previous / next slide buttons
- Album refresh control

### 🖼 Image Sources
- **Google Photos** shared albums
- **Immich** (direct API): album, person, favorites, all, random, or a custom search, with full metadata
- **PhotoPrism** (direct API): album, person, favorites, all, or a custom search, with full metadata
- **iCloud** Shared Albums (public link), with capture date + captions
- **Synology Photos** (direct API): favorites, albums, people, places, tags or subjects, with full metadata
- **Nextcloud**: an authenticated WebDAV folder (app-password auth, recursive, full metadata), or a public Nextcloud Photos album link (no login, full metadata)
- **Ente Photos** public album links (no login, end-to-end encrypted, with full metadata)
- **Local folder** paths and NAS mounted directories
- Home Assistant **Media Source** (local media, Jellyfin, ...)
- Optional recursive scanning

### 📍 EXIF & Location (local / NAS / Immich / PhotoPrism / Synology / Nextcloud / Ente)
- Reads capture date so date-filter modes work (EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` with `OffsetTimeOriginal` for local files; Immich's own capture date for the Immich provider)
- Surfaces GPS as `latitude` / `longitude` camera attributes
- Human-readable `location` label (reverse-geocoded via OpenStreetMap Nominatim for local files, or Immich's own place data); per-album opt-out for geocoding in the integration's Configure dialog

### 🗓 Filter & Order by Date
- Date filter: last 7 / 30 / 365 days, this month, this year, **On this day** memories
- Order modes: random, album order, **newest taken**, **oldest taken**, **newest added**, **oldest added**
- Capture date and upload date exposed as camera attributes (with paired-photo support)

### ⏯ Pause / Resume
- Pause switch holds the current slide indefinitely
- Manual "Previous slide" and "Next slide" buttons still work while paused
- Previous and Next swap pre-rendered frames for immediate navigation
- A configurable navigation buffer retains previous frames and pre-renders upcoming frames (even in random order)
- Survives Home Assistant restarts

### ✨ Transitions
- Smooth slide transitions rendered in the browser, so they stay buttery even on lower-end hardware
- Effects: `random`, `none`, `fade`, `slide-left`, `slide-right`, `slide-up`, `slide-down`, `wipe-left`, `wipe-right`, `zoom`
- `random` picks a different effect per slide (and avoids repeating the previous one)
- Configurable duration and CSS easing
- Aspect ratio + fill mode inheritance from the camera entity (cover / contain / blur backdrop)

### 🎨 Smart Rendering Engine

#### Orientation Mismatch Handling

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Pair** | Display two mismatched images side by side |
| **Single** | Render single image using selected fill mode |
| **Avoid** | Skip mismatched images |

#### Fill Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Blur** | Image over blurred background |
| **Cover** | Crop to fill canvas |
| **Contain** | Fit inside canvas with bars |

#### Layout Options
- Configurable aspect ratio such as 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16
- Shuffle or album order
- Pair divider size/color control

## 🎛 Runtime Configuration

The following entities allow you to adjust slideshow behavior without restarting Home Assistant.

| Entity Type | Name | Default | Accepted Values | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Number | Slide interval | 60 | Any positive integer (seconds) | Time between slides |
| Number | Album refresh | 24 | Any positive integer (hours) | How often album contents refresh |
| Number | Pair divider size | 8 | 0-64 (px) | Width of divider between paired images |
| Number | Pair minimum gap | 0 (off) | 0-50 (% of album) | Opt-in: above 0, excludes candidates within this percentage of the current slide's index (and shuffles the rest) when picking an orientation-mismatch pairing partner, so nearby/same-session shots aren't paired together. At 0, pairing uses the original nearest-candidate search |
| Number | Navigation buffer | 2 | 0-10 (slides) | Fully rendered slides cached before and after the current frame for immediate Previous/Next navigation |
| Number | Image cache size | 75 | 50-1000 (MB) | Memory budget for downloaded image data (per album) |
| Select | Fill mode | blur | blur, cover, contain | How images fill the canvas |
| Select | Orientation mismatch | pair | pair, single, avoid | Handling of portrait and landscape mismatch |
| Select | Order mode | random | random, album_order, newest_taken, oldest_taken, newest_added, oldest_added | Slide ordering behavior |
| Select | Aspect ratio | 16:9 | 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and more | Canvas aspect ratio |
| Select | Max resolution | 4K (2160p) | 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K (2160p), original | Cap output resolution by short edge; use original to render at native size |
| Select | Date filter | off | off, last_7_days, last_30_days, last_365_days, this_month, this_year, on_this_day | Restrict the slideshow to a date window based on photo capture date |
| Text | Pair divider color | #FFFFFF | Hex, named colors, transparent | Divider color between paired images |
| Switch | Pause slideshow | off | on / off | Hold the current frame; advances pause until turned off |

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Pick the provider that matches where your photos live:

| Provider | Best for | Date filter / ordering | Location | Description caption |
|----------|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Google Photos** | A shared album link | ✅ (dates only) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Immich** | An Immich server (album, person, favorites, all, search) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **PhotoPrism** | A PhotoPrism server (album, person, favorites, all, search) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **iCloud** | An iCloud Shared Album public link | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Synology** | A Synology Photos library (favorites, albums, people, places, tags, subjects) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Nextcloud (folder)** | Any folder in your Nextcloud files (WebDAV, app password) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Nextcloud (public link)** | A public Nextcloud Photos album share link (no login) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Ente Photos** | A public Ente album link (no login, end-to-end encrypted) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Local Folder** | Files on the HA host / NAS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Media Source** | Any HA media source with no API (local media, Jellyfin, ...) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> Media Source and Google Photos serve photos as URLs, so there is no EXIF
> to read. For full metadata (dates, location, description), use **Local
> Folder** for local/NAS files or the **Immich** / **PhotoPrism** provider for
> a self-hosted photo server. The Media Source route also works with those but
> without metadata, so prefer the direct provider when you have one.

### Google Photos

1. Open a shared Google Photos album  
2. Copy the shared link such as `https://photos.app.goo.gl/...`  
3. Add the integration  
4. Paste the link  

---

### Immich

The **Immich** provider connects straight to your [Immich](https://immich.app/)
server for **full photo metadata**: capture date, GPS/location, and description
all work, and you can slideshow far more than just an album. If you have an
Immich server, prefer this over the Media Source route.

1. In Immich, create an API key: **Account Settings → API Keys → New API Key**.
   Read scopes are enough: `server.about`, `asset.read`, `asset.view`,
   `asset.download`, `album.read`, `person.read`. `server.about` is what the
   setup step uses to check the URL and key, so setup fails without it.
2. Add the integration and choose **Immich (direct API, full metadata)**.
3. Enter your Immich URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:2283`) and the API key.
4. Give it a name, tick what you want to show, and choose the image quality.

#### Choosing what to show

Tick any mix of these and they are combined into one slideshow:

| Option | What it adds |
|--------|--------------|
| **Albums** | Photos from the albums you pick (searchable, with **Select all**) |
| **People** | Photos of the people you pick (searchable, with **Select all**) |
| **Include favorites** | Everything you have favorited in Immich |

Immich has no "OR" search, so the integration queries each album and each
person separately and merges the results, deduplicated. That means **People**
gives you every photo that includes any of them (not only the group shots where
they all appear together), and you can freely mix albums, people and favorites -
for example "the Family album OR these 5 people OR my favorites". **Leave
everything empty to show your whole library (all photos).**

**Advanced:** you can also add an Immich search filter (JSON) to fold its results
into the same slideshow. It is passed to
Immich's [`search/metadata`](https://api.immich.app/endpoints/search/searchAssets)
endpoint (with `type` forced to images). Examples:

```json
{ "city": "Paris", "isFavorite": true }
```
```json
{ "country": "Japan", "takenAfter": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

#### Image quality

- **Preview** (default) - a downscaled preview; smoothest slideshow.
- **Full size** - the large rendered version.
- **Original** - the untouched original file (largest, slowest).

#### Notes

- The API key is sent **only as a server-side request header**, so it never
  appears in the camera's `current_url` attribute or reaches the browser. Home
  Assistant fetches and re-serves the images; your Immich server is never
  exposed to the dashboard client.
- Capture dates come from the asset list up front, so date filters and date
  ordering work immediately. Location and description are filled in by a
  background pass (one lightweight call per photo, cached), so they appear
  shortly after the first load, the same way local-folder EXIF does.

---

### PhotoPrism

The **PhotoPrism** provider connects straight to your
[PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) server for **full photo metadata**:
capture date, GPS/location, and description all work, and you can combine
albums, people and favorites into one slideshow. If you have a PhotoPrism
server, prefer this over the Media Source route.

1. Add the integration and choose **PhotoPrism (direct API, full metadata)**.
2. Enter your PhotoPrism URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:2342`).
3. Choose how to authenticate:
   - **App password** (recommended) - in PhotoPrism go to **Settings → Account
     → Apps and Devices** and create one, then paste it here.
   - **Username + password** - your normal PhotoPrism login. The password is
     stored so the integration can refresh its session automatically; it is
     kept on the server side and never reaches the browser.
4. Give it a name, tick what you want to show, and choose the image quality.

#### Choosing what to show

Works exactly like the Immich picker - tick any mix and they are combined into
one slideshow:

| Option | What it adds |
|--------|--------------|
| **Albums** | Photos from the albums you pick (searchable, with **Select all**) |
| **People** | Photos of the people you pick (searchable, with **Select all**) |
| **Include favorites** | Everything you have favorited in PhotoPrism |

PhotoPrism has no "OR" across filters, so the integration queries each album and
each person separately and merges the results, deduplicated - so **People**
gives you every photo that includes any of them, and you can freely mix albums,
people and favorites. **Leave everything empty to show your whole library.**

**Advanced:** you can also add a PhotoPrism
[search query](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/search/filters/) to fold
its results into the same slideshow, for example:

```
color:red
```
```
country:jp year:2023
```

#### Image quality

- **Preview** (default, 1280px) - smoothest slideshow.
- **Full size** (1920px) - more detail.
- **High detail** (2560px) - largest, slowest.

#### Notes

- PhotoPrism serves thumbnails with a rotatable preview token in the URL (its
  own cookie-free scheme), so no login token is ever placed in the image URL.
  The integration reads the preview token from case-insensitive search response
  headers or, with username/password authentication, from the login response.
- All photo metadata (date, location, description) comes back inline with the
  photo list, so date filters, location and captions work from the first load
  with no background pass.

---

### iCloud Shared Album

The **iCloud** provider slideshows a **public iCloud Shared Album**. No Apple ID
or password is needed - the album's share link is the only credential, the same
way anyone with the link can view it on the web.

1. In the **Photos** app (iPhone/iPad/Mac), open the shared album, tap the
   people/share icon, and enable **Public Website** (then copy that link). The
   link looks like `https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B2Xabc...`.
2. Add the integration, choose **iCloud Shared Album**, paste the link, give it
   a name, and pick an image quality.

#### Image quality

- **Full size** (default) - the largest version Apple generated (usually around
  2048px); best for a slideshow.
- **Preview** - a small thumbnail; fastest / least bandwidth.

#### Notes

- **Capture date and captions work** (both come inline with the album data), so
  date filters, date ordering, and the caption overlay all apply.
- **No location.** Apple strips GPS from shared-album web data, so the
  `latitude`/`longitude`/`location` attributes stay empty (same as Google
  Photos).
- Contributors can keep adding photos to the album; new ones show up on the next
  refresh.
- The image URLs Apple hands out are signed and expire after about a day, so the
  integration re-fetches them on every album refresh.
- Image downloads marked `application/octet-stream` are accepted only from
  `icloud-content.com` and its subdomains, checked after redirects. Download
  limits and image decoding checks still apply. HEIC/HEIF decoding depends on
  the codecs available in your Home Assistant installation.

#### Testing slow legacy albums (v1.9.2 pre-release)

For legacy Shared Albums that fail during setup or the first refresh, v1.9.2
adds request-stage diagnostics and retries. It does not change the CloudKit
backend or the image decoder.

- Each listing or image-URL request has a 15-second connection limit, a
  60-second idle-read limit and a 90-second total limit. These are per-request
  limits, not a deadline for loading the whole album.
- A timeout, connection/payload failure or selected transient HTTP error gets
  one retry after one second. Successful URL batches are not repeated. TLS
  errors, invalid links, rate limits and other non-transient failures are not
  retried within the request.
- Failures identify link validation, photo listing, or the image-URL batch
  number, with the host, endpoint, attempt, elapsed time and error type/status.
  These request diagnostics omit the share token and raw response contents.
- Apple's HTTP 330 partition redirects are accepted from either the JSON body
  or response headers, limited to one redirect to an Apple shared-streams host.

To test: HACS → Album Slideshow → three-dot menu → **Redownload** → **v1.9.2**,
then restart Home Assistant and retry the entry. If it still fails, share the
new `Error querying iCloud album` or `iCloud validation failed` message after
checking it for personal information. No album share link is needed for this
diagnostic test. **v1.9.1 remains the stable release.**

---

### Synology Photos

The **Synology** provider connects straight to the **Photos** package on your
Synology NAS for **full photo metadata** (capture date, GPS location and
captions). Like the Immich and PhotoPrism providers, you can combine any mix of
**favorites, albums (including albums shared with you), people, places, tags and
subjects** into one slideshow, from either the **personal** ("My Photos") or
**shared** ("Shared Space") library.

1. Add the integration and choose **Synology Photos (direct API, full
   metadata)**.
2. Enter your DSM address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:5000`, or your HTTPS /
   QuickConnect URL) and an account username and password.
3. Choose the **Personal** or **Shared** library.
4. If the account has **two-factor authentication**, also enter a current
   6-digit code. This is only needed once - a trusted-device token is stored so
   later refreshes never prompt for a code again.
5. Tick what you want to show (favorites, albums, people, places, tags,
   subjects) - or leave everything unticked for **all photos** - then name it
   and choose an image quality.

> **Combining sources.** Synology has no "OR" across categories, so the
> integration queries each ticked album/person/place/tag/subject separately and
> merges the results (duplicates removed). Favorites and subjects are a Personal
> library feature.

#### Image quality

Synology serves pre-generated thumbnails:

- **Large** (default) - the biggest thumbnail; best for a slideshow.
- **Medium** - a good balance of detail and bandwidth.
- **Small** - a small thumbnail; fastest / least bandwidth.

#### Notes

- **Date, location and captions all work** - Synology returns capture date, GPS
  coordinates and a reverse-geocoded place name inline, so date filters, date
  ordering, the location attribute, and the caption overlay all apply.
- The password is stored so the integration can re-authenticate when its session
  expires. The session id is sent only server-side (it never appears in the
  camera's image URL or the browser).
- New photos added to the album or library show up on the next refresh.
- Albums that another user shared with your account appear under **Albums**
  tagged "(shared)"; they are fetched by their share passphrase.

> **Use a dedicated account.** Create a normal (non-admin) DSM user, give it
> access only to the Photos content you want to show, and use that here rather
> than your admin login.

---

### Nextcloud

The **Nextcloud** provider has two connection modes, both with **full photo
metadata** (capture date, GPS location and captions): an authenticated
**WebDAV folder**, or a public **Nextcloud Photos album link** that needs no
login. Add the integration, choose **Nextcloud**, then pick a connection type.

#### Authenticated WebDAV folder

Slideshows **any folder in your Nextcloud files** over WebDAV. Works on any
Nextcloud server - no Photos or Memories app is required.

1. In Nextcloud, create an **app password**: **Settings -> Security ->
   Devices & sessions -> Create new app password**. Copy the generated
   password (it is shown only once).
2. Choose **Authenticated WebDAV folder**.
3. Enter your server URL (e.g. `https://cloud.example.com`), your username, and
   the app password.
4. Point it at a **folder path** (e.g. `Photos/Family`), or leave it blank for
   your whole files root. Tick **Include subfolders** to recurse.
5. Name it and pick an image quality.

#### Public album link

Slideshows a **public Nextcloud Photos album share**, with no Nextcloud
login stored or required.

1. In the Nextcloud **Photos** app, open the album you want to share and
   create a **public link share** (or use an existing one).
2. Choose **Public album link**.
3. Paste the share link (e.g.
   `https://cloud.example.com/apps/photos/public/AbC123`).
4. Name it and pick an image quality.

#### Image quality

- **Preview** (default) - a resized thumbnail; smoothest slideshow.
- **Original** - the untouched original file (largest, slowest).

#### Notes

- **Date, location and captions all work in both modes.** Nextcloud has no
  metadata-only API, so the integration reads EXIF the same way the **Local
  Folder** provider does: it downloads each original photo once in the
  background and reads its EXIF/IPTC/XMP. Progress is tracked by the
  **Enrichment progress** diagnostic sensor, and the same reverse-geocoding
  opt-out applies in the integration's **Configure** dialog.
- **Folder mode:** the app password is stored so the integration can re-list
  the folder on each refresh. It is sent to Nextcloud server-side only (HTTP
  Basic auth) and never appears in the camera's image URL or the browser.
- **Public link mode:** no credentials are stored - the share token embedded
  in the link is the only thing the server checks. Anyone with the link (or
  the camera's image URL) can view the photos, same as opening the share
  page directly.
- New photos dropped into the folder or added to the shared album show up on
  the next refresh.
- Videos and non-image files are skipped.

---

### Ente Photos

The **Ente** provider slideshows a **public Ente album link**, with **full
photo metadata** (capture date, GPS location and captions). No Ente account,
password or API key is involved.

Ente is **end-to-end encrypted**, so this provider works differently from the
others: the album's decryption key travels in the link itself and never
reaches Ente's servers. Home Assistant downloads the encrypted bytes and
decrypts them locally, then serves the decrypted image to your dashboard.

1. In Ente (mobile or web), open the album, tap **Share** and create a
   **public link**.
2. Copy the link. It looks like
   `https://albums.ente.io/?t=TOKEN#KEY`.
3. Add the integration and choose **Ente Photos (public album link)**.
4. Paste the link, name the album and pick an image quality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Copy the whole link, including everything after the `#`.** That fragment
> is the album's decryption key. Without it the photos cannot be decrypted,
> and some apps truncate links at the `#` when sharing them. If setup fails
> with "that does not look like an Ente public album link", a missing
> fragment is the usual cause.

#### Image quality

- **Full quality** (default) - the original file, decrypted locally.
- **Preview** - Ente's smaller pre-generated thumbnail; much faster to load
  and lighter on CPU, noticeably softer on a large display.

#### Self-hosted Ente

Leave **API endpoint** blank to use Ente's hosted service. If you run your own
Ente (museum) server, enter its API URL there, for example
`https://api.photos.example.com`.

#### Notes

- **Date, location and captions all work**, and unlike the folder-style
  providers they cost nothing extra: Ente returns metadata alongside the file
  list, so it is decrypted up front rather than by downloading every photo.
  Reverse-geocoding into a `location` label still applies, with the same
  opt-out in the integration's **Configure** dialog.
- **Decryption happens in Home Assistant.** Because there is no URL that
  serves a decrypted image, the camera's `current_url` attribute shows an
  internal `ente://<id>` reference instead of a real link. The access token
  and decryption key are never placed in an image URL or exposed to the
  browser.
- The link's access token and collection key are stored in the config entry so
  the integration can re-list and decrypt on each refresh.
- Full-quality mode decrypts each original in Home Assistant. On a low-powered
  host (a Pi, say) with very large photos, **Preview** gives a smoother
  slideshow.
- Password-protected album links are not supported yet.
- Videos and live photos are skipped.
- Photos added to the album show up on the next refresh.

---

### Local Folder or NAS

Use any folder accessible to Home Assistant.

Helpful path mappings:

| Input | Resolves To |
|-------|------------|
| `/local/...` | `/config/www/...` |
| `media/...` | `/media/...` |
| `media/local/...` | `/media/...` |

For NAS:
- Mount it first
- Use the mounted path

#### 📍 EXIF capture date & location (local / NAS only)

For local-folder entries the integration reads EXIF metadata in the
background after every refresh:

- **Capture date** — `DateTimeOriginal` is preferred; if missing, the file's
  modification time is used so date-based ordering still works for
  screenshots and scans. When `OffsetTimeOriginal` is present (most modern
  cameras and phones) it is honoured; otherwise the timestamp is interpreted
  as the host's local time.
- **GPS coordinates** — `GPSLatitude`/`GPSLongitude` are exposed as the
  `latitude` / `longitude` camera attributes. `(0, 0)` "null island" stamps
  are ignored.
- **Reverse-geocoded location** — by default the integration calls the
  public [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) (OpenStreetMap)
  service to translate coordinates into a human-readable label such as
  `"Lisbon, Portugal"`, exposed as the `location` attribute. Coordinates
  are rounded to **~100 m** before lookup and the answer is cached on disk,
  so the same neighbourhood is only ever fetched once. Nominatim's
  free-tier policy (1 req/sec, identifying User-Agent) is respected.

**Privacy / opt-out:** if you'd rather not send any coordinates to
OpenStreetMap, open *Settings → Devices & Services → Album Slideshow → your
album → Configure* and turn off **Reverse-geocode EXIF GPS coordinates**.
The `latitude`/`longitude` attributes still work; only the `location`
label is suppressed. The opt-out is per-album.

Progress for both phases is exposed as the **Enrichment progress**
diagnostic sensor (percent complete, with `phase`, `exif_done`,
`geocode_done` etc. as attributes).

---

### Media Source (local media, Jellyfin, ...)

The **Media Source** provider points the slideshow at any Home Assistant
[Media Source](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_source/)
folder. This is the easiest way to slideshow an **Immich** album or a
recognized person, and it also works with local media, Jellyfin, and any
other integration that exposes a media source.

1. Add the integration and choose **Media Source (Immich, local media, ...)**.
2. Give the album a **name**.
3. Paste the **Media Source id** of the folder you want (it starts with
   `media-source://`). See below for how to find it.

The integration walks that folder (and its subfolders) collecting images,
skipping videos, system folders (e.g. Synology `@eaDir`), and non-web
formats (`.psd`, `.tiff`, `.heic`, RAW). It re-reads the folder on every
album refresh, so photos you add later show up automatically.

#### How to find the `media-source://` id

**Immich**

1. Open the sidebar **Media** browser (or a Media card).
2. Browse into **Immich → Albums / People / Tags → your album**.
3. The folder's id looks like
   `media-source://immich/<config-entry-id>|albums|<album-id>` (people and
   tags use `|people|` / `|tags|`). To copy the exact value, open your
   browser's developer tools → **Network** tab, filter for `media_source`,
   click into the folder, and read the folder's `media_content_id` from the
   `media_source/browse_media` response.

**Local media (e.g. a NAS folder under `/media`)**

You can build the id from the path. Take whatever comes after `/media/` and
prefix it with `media-source://media_source/local/`:

| Media path | Media Source id |
|------------|-----------------|
| `/media/local/Pictures/Family` | `media-source://media_source/local/Pictures/Family` |
| `/media/Photos/2024` | `media-source://media_source/local/Photos/2024` |

> Point the id at a **folder**, not a single file. Don't URL-encode spaces
> in the config field, type them normally.

#### ⚠️ Metadata limitation

Media Source hands the slideshow **URLs**, not files, so there is **no EXIF
to read**. For Media Source albums this means:

- **no date filter / date ordering** (no capture or upload date)
- **no GPS `latitude` / `longitude` / `location`**
- **no description caption**

This is the same limitation as the Google Photos provider. If your photos
are local files (for example a NAS folder mounted under `/media`), use the
**Local Folder** provider instead of Media Source to get full EXIF-based
dates, location, and description captions.

### 📋 Camera Attributes

The slideshow camera exposes per-frame metadata as attributes (use with `state_attr('camera.x', '<name>')` in templates):

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `album_title` | string | Title of the source album |
| `media_count` | int | Photos in the active playlist (after date filter) |
| `media_count_total` | int | Total photos available before filtering |
| `current_index` | int | Index of the current slide |
| `current_filename` | string \| null | Source filename when known |
| `current_url` | string \| null | URL of the current slide. For Ente this is an internal `ente://<id>` reference, since the image is decrypted locally rather than fetched from a URL |
| `current_is_portrait` | bool \| null | Orientation of the current slide |
| `captured_at` | string \| list \| null | ISO-8601 capture date. List of `[primary, partner]` when paired (top/left first). For local files this is read from EXIF (or the file's mtime as a fallback). |
| `captured_at_primary` | string \| null | Capture date of the primary image only |
| `uploaded_at` | string \| null | ISO-8601 date when added to the album (Google Photos only) |
| `byte_size` | int \| null | Original file size in bytes (Google Photos only) |
| `latitude` | float \| null | GPS latitude in decimal degrees (local folder + Immich) |
| `longitude` | float \| null | GPS longitude in decimal degrees (local folder + Immich) |
| `location` | string \| null | Reverse-geocoded label (e.g. `"Lisbon, Portugal"`). Empty when reverse-geocoding is disabled or has not yet completed for this file. |
| `description` | string \| null | Free-text photo caption. From EXIF `ImageDescription` / IPTC `Caption-Abstract` / XMP `dc:description` (local folder), or the Immich photo description (Immich provider). |
| `caption_frames` | list | Structured per-image caption metadata: one entry for a normal slide, two (top/left first) for a pair. Each entry has `captured_at`, `location`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `description`. Used by the card's caption overlay. |
| `pair_orientation` | string \| null | How a paired slide is split: `horizontal` (left/right) or `vertical` (top/bottom). `null` for single slides. |
| `paused` | bool | Whether the slideshow is paused |
| `date_filter` | string | Active date filter mode |
| `frame_id` | int | Monotonic counter incremented on every committed slide. Used by the [card](#-album-slideshow-card) to detect new frames |
| `navigation_buffer_size` | int | Configured number of fully rendered slides retained in each direction |
| `previous_frames_cached` | int | Previous rendered frames currently available for immediate navigation |
| `next_frames_preloaded` | int | Upcoming rendered frames currently available for immediate navigation |
| `navigation_preloading` | bool | Whether the background worker is currently filling the upcoming-frame buffer |
| `last_navigation_outcome` | string \| null | Result of the latest manual action: `pending`, `displayed`, `not_available`, or `error` |
| `last_navigation_error` | string \| null | Error from the latest manual navigation attempt, when present |

## 🎞 Album Slideshow Card

The integration ships with a custom Lovelace card that does the slide-to-slide transition entirely in the browser. The server only renders one still per slide change; the card cross-fades in CSS, which the browser composites on the GPU. Result: a smooth dissolve on a Pi 4, even with several albums on screen.

The card is registered automatically when the integration loads; you do **not** need to add it as a HACS frontend repository or configure a Lovelace resource manually. After installing or upgrading, hard-refresh the dashboard once (Ctrl+Shift+R) so the browser picks up the script.

A visual editor is available - pick **Album Slideshow** from the card picker in Lovelace and the form will appear automatically.

### Minimal example

```yaml
type: custom:album-slideshow-card
entity: camera.album_slideshow_living_room
```

### Full options

```yaml
type: custom:album-slideshow-card
entity: camera.album_slideshow_living_room
transition: random          # random | none | fade | slide-left
                            #   | slide-right | slide-up | slide-down
                            #   | wipe-left | wipe-right | zoom
duration: 800               # ms; CSS transition length
easing: ease-in-out         # any CSS timing function (ease, linear, cubic-bezier(...))
aspect_ratio: 16/9          # CSS aspect-ratio value (16/9, 4/3, 1/1, auto)
fit: auto                   # auto | cover | contain
                            # auto inherits the camera's fill_mode (cover / contain / blur)
background: '#000'          # color shown behind contained images
tap_action: none            # none | more-info
caption:                    # overlay the photo's date, location and/or description
  show: [date, location]    #   any of: date, location, description (order = display order)
  position: bottom-left     #   top/center/bottom + -left/-center/-right, or center
  date_format: medium       #   medium | full | month_year | year | numeric
                            #     | weekday | relative, or a custom token string
                            #     (YYYY, MMMM, MMM, MM, M, DD, D, dddd, ddd, REL)
  per_image: true           #   caption each half of a portrait pair separately
  color: '#ffffff'          #   any CSS color
  font_size: 14px           #   any CSS size
  font_weight: medium       #   light | normal | medium | semibold | bold
  shadow: true              #   drop shadow for readability on bright photos
```

### Notes

- `transition: random` picks a different effect per slide and avoids repeating the previous one.
- `fit: auto` reads the camera's `fill_mode` attribute. `blur` renders the slide as `contain` plus a blurred backdrop layer behind it.
- **Caption overlay:** omit the `caption:` block (or set `show: []`) to disable it. The date comes from `captured_at`; `location` and `description` come from photo metadata. Location and description are available with the **Local Folder** and **Immich** providers (they are simply skipped when a photo has none); Google Photos and Media Source slides show only the date. On a portrait pair, `per_image: true` anchors each photo's own date/location/description to its half; set it to `false` for a single caption over the whole frame.
- `date_format` accepts a preset name or a custom token string. Presets are locale-aware (they follow your Home Assistant language). Example custom format: `'D MMMM YYYY'` -> `29 July 2023`. The `REL` token inserts relative time, so `'D MMMM YYYY - REL'` -> `29 July 2023 - 3 years ago`.
- Every slide commit increments the camera's `frame_id` attribute. The card cache-busts the camera proxy URL with that value, so the browser refetches a fresh JPEG on every change instead of serving a stale cached image.
- If the entity is unavailable, the card shows a "Camera not ready" placeholder.

## 🎨 Transparent Divider

To remove visible spacing between paired images:

1. Set **Pair divider color** to `transparent`
2. Keep divider size greater than `0`

Also accepted values:
- `none`
- `clear`
- `rgba(0,0,0,0)`
- `transperant` common misspelling

When transparency is used, the integration outputs PNG to preserve alpha.

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Google Photos

- Public shared albums only (link sharing must be enabled)
- Up to 20,000 photos per album
- Videos are skipped
- Internet connection required
- Relies on Google's public web endpoints; if Google changes them, the integration falls back to a 300-photo limit until the scraper is updated
- The last successful album fetch is cached to disk; if a refresh fails or returns no photos, the slideshow keeps running with the cached list

### Immich

- Requires an Immich server reachable from Home Assistant and an API key
- Videos are skipped
- Home Assistant fetches and re-serves images, so the Immich server does not need to be reachable from the dashboard client (and the API key never leaves the server)
- Location and description are read per photo in the background, so they appear shortly after the first load

### General

- Images only  
- No video support
